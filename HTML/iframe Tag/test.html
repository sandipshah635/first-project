   <pre> The virus can spread from an infected personâ€™s mouth
     or nose in small liquid particles when they cough,
      sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. These particles range
       from
     larger respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols.
    You can be infected by breathing in the virus 
    if you are near someone who has COVID-19, or by touching
     a contaminated surface and then your eyes, nose or mouth.
      The virus spreads more easily indoors and in crowded 
      settings.
